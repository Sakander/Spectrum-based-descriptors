# Connection-based-descriptors
Computational technique to compute certain connection-based topological descriptors

Let G be a graph for which you would like to compute a connection-based topological descriptors.

Step 1. Draw G on HyperChem and generate .hin file for G.
Step 2. Feed .hin file to TopoCluj to calculate the distance matrix D(G) and generate .m file.
Step 3. Paste the matrix and order of G in the ConnectionIndices.m file in B and n resepctively.

Run the ConnectionIndices.m file to obtain your result.
