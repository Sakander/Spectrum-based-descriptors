# Spectrum-based-descriptors
Computational technique to compute certain spectrum based topological descriptors

Let G be a graph for which you would like to compute a sepctrum-based topological descriptors.

Step 1. Draw G on newGraph and check adjacency matrix as an invariant by going to "Invariants" tab to "Select Invariant".

Copy the adjacency matrix by right clicking on the matrix.

Step 2. Paste the matrix and order of G in the SpectrumIndices.m file in B and n resepctively.

Run the SpectrumIndices.m file to obtain your result.
